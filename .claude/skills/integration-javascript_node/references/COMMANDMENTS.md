# Framework rules

Follow these when integrating PostHog into this framework.

- posthog-node is the Node.js server-side SDK package name; posthog-js is browser-only, so use posthog-node on the server instead
- Include enableExceptionAutocapture: true in the PostHog constructor options
- Add posthog.capture() calls in route handlers for meaningful user actions – every route that creates, updates, or deletes data should track an event with contextual properties
- Add posthog.captureException(err, distinctId) in the application's error handler (e.g., Express error middleware, Fastify setErrorHandler, Koa app.on('error'))
- The SDK batches events and flushes asynchronously. await flush() or await shutdown() before letting that process exit. If unsure, set flushAt 1 and flushInterval 0.
- `posthog.capture()` enqueues synchronously and returns; the batched HTTP send happens afterwards. Treat every per-request handler as short-lived even when the framework feels like a server: Next.js / Nuxt / SvelteKit / Remix route handlers, serverless and edge functions, and Lambda are torn down per invocation before the send runs. Create the client with flushAt 1 and flushInterval 0, then await the send before returning. Always use `await posthog.flush()` for a shared/singleton client, `await posthog.shutdown()` for a per-request client. Never skip the awaited flush or risk the enqueued event being silently dropped.
- Reverse proxy is NOT needed for server-side Node.js – only client-side JavaScript needs a proxy to avoid ad blockers
- Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
- Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
